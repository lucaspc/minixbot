minixbot
========

The development of a informative bot for channel #minix in irc.freenode.net

Instructions:
-To store things in bot type 'racoonbot: key =save value' or through '/msg racoonbot key =save value'

-To call keys, just type: 'racoonbot: key' or '/msg racoonbot key'

-All the keys and values are stored in memory file of my computer, but the default memory is in this repository.

Collaborators:

-lucaspc

-zacts

Bugs to correct:

-Multiple open of chats for racbot

Notes:

-Inspired by perlbot at #perl in irc.freenode.net.

-Stored in one of Cloud 9 Servers.

-Add points to names using the syntax 'name++' and 'exp name' to see the points.

-Save and load keys and values.

-Log sent messages.

-Log acknowlegments.
